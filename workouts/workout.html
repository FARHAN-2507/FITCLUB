            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How many days per week should I work out?</h3>
                <p>It's recommended to exercise at least 3-4 days per week for general fitness. However, the optimal
                    frequency may vary depending on your goals and fitness level.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What are some good warm-up exercises?</h3>
                <p>Common warm-up exercises include jogging, jumping jacks, arm circles, and dynamic stretches like leg
                    swings and arm swings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is it better to do cardio before or after strength training?</h3>
                <p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Some prefer doing cardio before strength training to warm up,
                    while others prefer doing it after to maximize energy for lifting.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How long should my workouts be?</h3>
                <p>Workout duration depends on your fitness goals and schedule. Aim for at least 30 minutes of
                    moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week for general health.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I stretch before or after my workout?</h3>
                <p>Dynamic stretching before exercise helps warm up muscles, while static stretching after exercise
                    helps improve flexibility and cool down muscles.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What should I eat before and after a workout?</h3>
                <p>Before a workout, consume a balanced meal or snack containing carbohydrates and protein. Afterward,
                    focus on replenishing carbohydrates and protein to aid recovery.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How can I stay motivated to exercise regularly?</h3>
                <p>Set realistic goals, find activities you enjoy, vary your routine, track your progress, and enlist
                    social support to stay motivated.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I exercise while pregnant?</h3>
                <p>In most cases, yes. Consult with your healthcare provider before starting or continuing an exercise
                    program during pregnancy, and listen to your body's cues.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What should I do if I feel pain during exercise?</h3>
                <p>Stop the activity causing pain and rest. If pain persists, consult with a healthcare professional to
                    assess and address the issue.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need to lift heavy weights to build muscle?</h3>
                <p>No, you can build muscle with lighter weights and higher repetitions, as well as bodyweight
                    exercises. Focus on progressive overload and proper form.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How important is rest and recovery?</h3>
                <p>Rest and recovery are essential for muscle repair, growth, and overall performance improvement. Aim
                    for adequate sleep, hydration, and rest days in your routine.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Should I take supplements for better results?</h3>
                <p>Supplements can complement a balanced diet and exercise routine, but they are not essential. Consult
                    with a healthcare professional before taking any supplements.</p>
